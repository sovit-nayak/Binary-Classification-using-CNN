Binary Classification Dog vs Cat prediction using CNN
# CNN Binary Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform binary classification on a dataset of images. The goal is to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. The project uses a Jupyter Notebook to implement and train the model.

## Contents

- **Dog_vs_Cat_classification.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model (not included in the repository; instructions for downloading are provided).
- **Requirements.txt**: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CNN-binary-classification.git
performance.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. ReLU activation and softmax are used for the output layer to perform binary classification.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also generated to better visualize the results.
